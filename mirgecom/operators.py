def grad_operator(discr, dd_vol, dd_faces, u, flux):
    r"""Compute a DG gradient for the input *u* with flux given by *flux*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    discr: grudge.discretization.DiscretizationCollection
        the discretization to use
    dd_vol: grudge.dof_desc.DOFDesc
        the degree-of-freedom tag associated with the volume discretization.
        This determines the type of quadrature to be used.
    dd_faces: grudge.dof_desc.DOFDesc
        the degree-of-freedom tag associated with the surface discretization.
        This determines the type of quadrature to be used.
    u: meshmode.dof_array.DOFArray or numpy.ndarray
        the function (or container of functions) for which gradient is to be
        calculated
    flux: numpy.ndarray
        the boundary flux across the faces of the element for each component
        of *u*

    Returns
    -------
    meshmode.dof_array.DOFArray or numpy.ndarray
        the dg gradient operator applied to *u*

def div_operator(discr, dd_vol, dd_faces, v, flux):
    r"""Compute DG divergence of vector-valued func *v* with flux given by *flux*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    discr: grudge.discretization.DiscretizationCollection
        the discretization to use
    dd_vol: grudge.dof_desc.DOFDesc
        the degree-of-freedom tag associated with the volume discretization.

    dd_faces: grudge.dof_desc.DOFDesc
        the degree-of-freedom tag associated with the surface discretization.

    v: numpy.ndarray
        obj array of :class:`~meshmode.dof_array.DOFArray` (or container of such)
        representing the vector-valued functions for which divergence is to be
        calculated
    flux: numpy.ndarray
        the boundary flux for each function in v

    Returns
    -------
    meshmode.dof_array.DOFArray or numpy.ndarray
        the dg divergence operator applied to vector-valued function(s) *v*.
