    """Advance state from some time (t) to some time (t_final).

    Parameters
    ----------
    rhs
        Function that should return the time derivative of the state
    timestepper
        Function that advances the state from t=time to t=(time+dt), and
        returns the advanced state.
    checkpoint
        Function is user-defined and can be used to preform simulation status
        reporting, viz, and restart i/o.  A non-zero return code from this function
        indicates that this function should stop gracefully.
    get_timestep
        Function that should return dt for the next step. This interface allows
        user-defined adaptive timestepping. A negative return value indicated that
        the stepper should stop gracefully.
    state: numpy.ndarray
        Agglomerated object array containing at least the state variables that
        will be advanced by this stepper
    t_final: float
        Simulated time at which to stop
    t: float
        Time at which to start
    istep: int
        Step number from which to start

    Returns
    -------
    istep: int
        the current step number
    t: float
        the current time
    state: numpy.ndarray
