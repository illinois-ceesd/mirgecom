def lfr_flux(cv_tpair, f_tpair, normal, lam):
    r"""Compute Lax-Friedrichs/Rusanov flux after [Hesthaven_2008]_, Section 6.6.

    The Lax-Friedrichs/Rusanov flux is calculated as:

    .. math::

        f_{\mathtt{LFR}} = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{F}(q^-) + \mathbf{F}(q^+)) \cdot
        \hat{n} + \frac{\lambda}{2}(q^{-} - q^{+}),

    where $q^-, q^+$ are the scalar solution components on the interior and the
    exterior of the face on which the LFR flux is to be calculated, $\mathbf{F}$ is
    the vector flux function, $\hat{n}$ is the face normal, and $\lambda$ is the
    user-supplied jump term coefficient.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cv_tpair: :class:`grudge.trace_pair.TracePair`

        Solution trace pair for faces for which numerical flux is to be calculated

    f_tpair: :class:`grudge.trace_pair.TracePair`

        Physical flux trace pair on faces on which numerical flux is to be calculated

    normal: numpy.ndarray

        object array of :class:`meshmode.dof_array.DOFArray` with outward-pointing
        normals

    lam: :class:`meshmode.dof_array.DOFArray`

        lambda parameter for Lax-Friedrichs/Rusanov flux

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray

        object array of :class:`meshmode.dof_array.DOFArray` with the
        Lax-Friedrichs/Rusanov flux.
