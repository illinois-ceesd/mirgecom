    r"""Implement a slope limiter for bound-preserving properties.

    The implementation is summarized in [Zhang_2011]_, Sec. 2.3, Eq. 2.9,
    which uses a linear scaling factor

    .. math::

        \theta = \min\left( \left| \frac{M - \bar{u}_j}{M_j - \bar{u}_j} \right|,
                            \left| \frac{m - \bar{u}_j}{m_j - \bar{u}_j} \right|,
                           1 \right)

    to limit the high-order polynomials

    .. math::

        \tilde{p}_j = \theta (p_j - \bar{u}_j) + \bar{u}_j

    The lower and upper bounds are given by $m$ and $M$, respectively, and can be
    specified by the user. By default, no limiting is performed to the upper bound.

    The scheme is conservative since the cell average $\bar{u}_j$ is not
    modified in this operation. However, a boolean argument can be invoked to
    modify the cell average. Negative values may appear when changing polynomial
    order during execution or any extra interpolation (i.e., changing grids).
    If these negative values remain during the temporal integration, the current
    slope limiter will fail to ensure positive values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dcoll: :class:`grudge.discretization.DiscretizationCollection`

    field: meshmode.dof_array.DOFArray or numpy.ndarray
        A field to limit
    mmin: float
        Optional float with the target lower bound. Default to 0.0.
    mmax: float
        Optional float with the target upper bound. Default to None.
    modify_average: bool
        Flag to avoid modification the cell average. Defaults to False.

    Returns
    -------
    meshmode.dof_array.DOFArray or numpy.ndarray
        An array container containing the limited field(s).
