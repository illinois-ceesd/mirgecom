# This script is designed to patch the CEESD production capability into
# a proposed change to illinois-ceesd/mirgecom@main. The script reads the
# environment config file `.ci-support/production-testing-env.sh`, that
# should set up the expected control variables.
#
# The production capability to test against may be specified outright, or
# patched by the incoming development. The following vars control the
# production environment:
#
# PRODUCTION_BRANCH = The production branch (default=y1-production)
# PRODUCTION_FORK = The production fork (default=illinois-ceesd)
#
MIRGE_HOME=${1:-"."}
PRODUCTION_BRANCH=${PRODUCTION_BRANCH:-"y1-production"}
PRODUCTION_FORK=${PRODUCTION_FORK:-"illinois-ceesd"}
