**Questions for the review**:
- [ ] Is the scope and purpose of the PR clear?
  - [ ] The PR should have a description.
  - [ ] The PR should have a guide if needed (e.g., an ordering).
- [ ] Is every top-level method and class documented? Are things that should be documented actually so?
- [ ] Is the interface understandable? (I.e. can someone figure out what stuff does?) Is it well-defined?
- [ ] Does the implementation do what the docstring claims?
- [ ] Is everything that is implemented covered by tests?
- [ ] Do you see any immediate risks or performance disadvantages with the design? Example: what do interface normals attach to?
