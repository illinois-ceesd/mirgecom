# Toy Fortran parser for Loopy
#
# Unfortunately, f2py doesn't exist as a package on the package index:
# https://pypi.org/search/?q=f2py
#
# To explain the context of this a bit: f2py is a Fortran->Python wrapper generator that ships
# with numpy. Due to limitations of the old code base (no F90), Pearu (Peterson, original author of
# f2py) decided to restart from scratch, starting with a Fortran parser. That's as far as he got,
# and a forked version of this is in this repo.
