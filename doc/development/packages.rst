What Packages are Involved?
===========================

:mod:`mirgecom` relies on a number of other packages to do its job, which
depend on each other as illustrated in this graph:

.. graphviz::

   digraph deps {
   subgraph cluster_0 {
   label="emirge"
        mirgecom -> meshmode;
        grudge -> meshmode;
        mirgecom -> grudge;

        mirgecom -> loopy;
        grudge -> loopy;
        meshmode -> loopy;

        meshmode -> pyopencl;
        loopy -> pyopencl;

        meshmode -> modepy;

        loopy -> pymbolic;

        pyopencl -> pocl;

        mirgecom -> pytato;
        pytato -> loopy;
        pytato -> pymbolic;
        graph[style=dotted];
        }
   }

The source repository (and current branch) of most of these packages
in use is determined by the file
`requirements.txt in mirgecom <https://github.com/illinois-ceesd/mirgecom/blob/main/requirements.txt>`__.
