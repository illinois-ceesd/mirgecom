*MIRGE-Com* provides capabilities for solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equations for a number of mixture
species = $N_s$, with chemical reactions on unstructured meshes in a Discontinuous-Galerkin setting.  The formulation
presented here is after [Ihme_2014]_ and [Cook_2009]_. The basic conservation equations are as follows:

.. math::
    \partial_{t}{\rho} + \partial_{j}{\rho v_j} &= S_\rho \\
    \partial_{t}(\rho{E}) + \partial_j\left(\left\{\rho E + p\right\}v_j + q_j - \tau_{jk}v_k\right) &= S_{\rho E} \\
    \partial_{t}({\rho}{v_i}) + \partial_j\left(\rho v_i v_j + p\delta_{ij} - \tau_{ij}\right) &= S_{\rho v_i} \\
    \partial_{t}(\rho{Y}_{\alpha}) + \partial_j\left(\rho{Y}_{\alpha}v_j + (\mathbf{J}_{\alpha})_j\right) &= S_{\alpha},

with fluid density $\rho$, velocity components $v_i$, momentum density components $\rho v_i$, total energy $\rho E$,
and vector of species mass fractions ${Y}_{\alpha}$. The :ref:`thermodynamic pressure<eos-and-matprop>` of the fluid
is $p$.  ${\tau_{ij}}$ are the components of the :ref:`viscous stress tensor<viscous-stress-tensor>`, $q_i$ are the
components of the total :ref:`heat flux<heat-flux>` vector, and the components of the
species :ref:`diffusive flux<diffusive-flux>` vector are $(\mathbf{J}_{\alpha})_i)$. Mixtures have $N_s$ components
with $1 \le \alpha \le N_s$. Unless otherwise noted, repeated indices imply summation.

The equations can be recast in this more compact form:

.. math::

    \partial_t{\mathbf{Q}} + \partial_j{\mathbf{F}^{I}_j} = \partial_j{\mathbf{F}^{V}_j} + \mathbf{S},

where $\mathbf{Q}$ is the vector of conserved variables, $\mathbf{F}^I$ is the vector of inviscid fluxes,
$\mathbf{F}^V$ is the vector of viscous fluxes, and the vector of sources for each scalar equation  is $S$,
with the components of each following directly from above:

.. math::

   \mathbf{Q} = \begin{bmatrix}\rho\\\rho{E}\\\rho{v}_{i}\\\rho{Y}_{\alpha}\end{bmatrix},
   ~\mathbf{F}^{I}_{j} = \begin{bmatrix}\rho{v}_{j}\\\left(\rho{E}+p\right){v}_{j}\\
   \left(\rho{v}_{j}{v}_{i}+p\delta_{ij}\right)\\\rho{Y}_{\alpha}{v}_{j}\end{bmatrix},
   ~\mathbf{F}^V_{j} = \begin{bmatrix}0\\\left(\tau_{jk}{v}_{k}-{q}_{j}\right)\\{\tau}_{ij}\\
   -(\mathbf{J}_{\alpha})_{j}\end{bmatrix},
   ~\mathbf{S} = \begin{bmatrix}0\\E^{\mathtt{chem}}\\0\\W^{\mathtt{chem}}_{\alpha}\end{bmatrix}

where ${E}^{\mathtt{chem}}$, and $W^{\mathtt{chem}}_{\alpha}$, are the chemical reaction source terms
in the energy and species conservation equations, respectively.  See :ref:`Chemistry` for more details
on chemical reaction source terms, and :ref:`here<viscous-rhs>` for details on the 2nd order terms
in the viscous RHS.

.. _viscous-stress-tensor:

Viscous stress tensor
---------------------
The viscous stress tensor has components:

.. math::
    \tau_{ij} = \mu \left(\partial_j{v_i} + \partial_i{v_j}\right)
    +(\mu_B - \frac{2}{3}\mu)\partial_k{v_k}\delta_{ij}

with fluid velocity components ${v}_{i}$, the first coefficient of fluid
viscosity $\mu$, and bulk viscosity $\mu_B$.


.. _diffusive-flux:

Diffusive flux
--------------
The species diffusive fluxes are given by:

.. math::
   \mathbf{J}_{\alpha} = -\rho{d}_{(\alpha)}\nabla{Y}_{\alpha},

with gas density $\rho$, species diffusivities ${d}_{\alpha}$, and
species mass fractions ${Y}_{\alpha}$.  The parens $(\alpha)$ indicate no sum
over repeated indices is to be performed.


.. _heat-flux:

Heat flux
---------

The total heat flux $\mathbf{q}$ is calculated as the sum of the
conductive and diffusive components, $\mathbf{q}_{c}$ and $\mathbf{q}_{d}$,
respectively:

.. math::
   \mathbf{q} = \mathbf{q}_c + \mathbf{q}_d


Conductive heat flux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The conductive heat flux vector is defined as

.. math::
    \mathbf{q}_c = -\kappa\nabla{T},

where $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, and ${T}$ is the gas
temperature.

Diffusive heat flux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The diffusive heat flux vector is defined as

.. math::
   \mathbf{q}_d = {h}_{\alpha}\mathbf{J}_{\alpha},

with the species specific enthalpy ${h}_{\alpha}$, and the species
diffusive flux vector $\mathbf{J}_{\alpha}$.

.. _Chemistry:

Chemistry
---------

Chemical reactions introduce source terms in the energy and species conservation equations.
The species source term is the amount of mass produced for each species:

.. math::
   W^{\mathtt{chem}}_{\alpha} = w_{(\alpha)}\dot{\omega}_{\alpha},

where ${w}_{\alpha}$ is the molecular weight of each species, and $\dot{\omega}_{\alpha}$ is the net
chemical production rate for each species. Here, the parens $(\alpha)$ indicates no sum is to be performed
over repeated indices. 

The energy source term is the amount of thermal energy used to create each species:

.. math::
   E^{\mathtt{chem}} = -h^f_{\alpha}W^{\mathtt{chem}}_{\alpha},

where $h^f_{\alpha}$ is the enthalpy of formation for each species.

.. _eos-and-matprop:

Equations of State and Material properties
------------------------------------------

Equations of state (EOS) provide functions that relate the fluid state $Q$, and the
thermodynamic properties such as pressure $p$, temperature $T$, specific enthalpies $h_{\alpha}$,
and total energy $E$.  The EOS provided *MIRGE-Com* are documented in :mod:`mirgecom.eos`.

Material properties including the first coefficient of viscosity, $\mu$, bulk viscosity $\mu_B$,
thermal conductivity $\kappa$, and species diffusivities ${d}_{\alpha}$ depend on the state of
the fluid $\mathbf{Q}$, in general, and are provided by transport models.  Transport models provided
by *MIRGE-Com* are documented in :mod:`mirgecom.transport`.


.. _viscous-rhs:

Viscous RHS
-----------

How to discretize the conservation equations with DG, including how to handle the required fluxes,
particularly in the viscous setting, is a current topic of research and internal discussion.  The
following references are useful:

* "The DG Book:" Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Methods, [Hesthaven_2008]_
* The BR1 algorithm for discretization of NS, [Bassi_1997]_
* NS with reactions, [Ihme_2014]_, and [Cook_2009]_
* The BR2 algorithm, [Bassi_2000]_
* [Ayuso_2009]_

2nd order terms on the RHS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The viscous fluxes $\mathbf{F}^{V}$ are proportional to gradients of the fluid state variables,
introducing 2nd order terms on the RHS of the conservation equations. These 2nd order terms with their
relevant rhs component are summarized below.

Momentum equation
"""""""""""""""""
The 2nd order terms in the viscous RHS for the moementum equation are:

.. math::
   \partial_j \tau_{ij} = \left[\partial_j\left(\mu\partial_j{v}_i\right) +
   \partial_j\left(\mu\partial_i{v}_j\right) + \partial_j\left(\mu_{B} -
   \frac{2}{3}\mu\right)\partial_k{v}_k\delta_{ij}\right]


Energy equation
"""""""""""""""
The 2nd order terms in the energy equation RHS have convective, conductive, and
diffusive terms as follows:

- Convective part

.. math::
   \partial_j \tau_{jk} {v}_k = \left[\partial_j\left(\mu\partial_k{v}_j{v}_k\right) +
   \partial_j\left(\mu\partial_j{v}^2_k\right) + \partial_j\left(\mu_{B} -
   \frac{2}{3}\mu\right)\partial_m{v}_m\delta_{jk}{v}_k\right]
   

- Conductive part

The conductive heat part of the RHS is:

.. math::
   \partial_j{(q_{c})_j} = \partial_j\kappa\partial_j{T},

where $T$ is the fluid temperature.

- Diffusive part

The diffusive heat part of the RHS is:

.. math::
   \partial_j{(q_{d})_j} = \partial_j\left(\rho{h}_{\alpha}{d}_{(\alpha)}\partial_j{Y}_{\alpha}\right)
   
with fluid density $\rho$, species diffusivity ${d}_{(\alpha)}$, and species mass fractions
${Y}_{\alpha}$. 

Species equation
""""""""""""""""
The species diffusive transport RHS is:

.. math::
   \partial_j{(J_{\alpha})_j} = \partial_j\left(\rho{d}_{(\alpha)}\partial_j{Y}_{\alpha}\right),

with fluid density $\rho$, species diffusivity ${d}_{(\alpha)}$, and species mass fractions
${Y}_{\alpha}$.
