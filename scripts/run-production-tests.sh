#
# This script is designed to run the smoke tests for a collection of
# drivers. The drivers are each expected to be in the path:
# /path_to_mirgecom/driver_name_root_<driver_name>
#
# Each driver to test is expected to have a smoke test defined in:
# /driver_name_root_<driver_name>/scripts/smoke_test.sh
#
# See https://github.com/illinois-ceesd/drivers_y2-prediction/scripts/smoke_test.sh
# for an example `smoke_test.sh`.
